What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) ?\n","\n"," ▶ Object-oriented programming(OOP) is a style of programming characterized by the identification of classes of objects closely linked with the objects closely linked with the methods(functions) with which they are associated. It also includes ideas of inheritance of attributes and methods.\n","\n","2. What is a class in OOPS ?\n","\n"," ▶ In object-oriented programming, a class is a blueprint for creating objects(a particular data structure),providing intial values for state(member variables or attributes), and implementations of behavior(member functions or methods). The user-defined objects are created using the class keyword.\n","\n","3. What is an object in OOPs ?\n","\n"," ▶ An object is an instance of a class that encapsulates data and functionality including that data. Objects serve as the basic building blocks of OOP applications, embodying both the properties (data) and behaviors (methods) relevant to the software being developed.\n","\n","4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation ?\n","\n"," ▶ Abstraction in python simplifies complex systems, hiding implementations details for better code redability. Encapsulation safeguards data integrity by restricting direct access to an object's data and methods.\n","\n","5. What are dunder methods in Python ?\n","\n"," ▶ Dunder methods are special methods in python. They start and end with double underscores (hence the name)--like __init__,__str__,__len__ and __getitem__.They allow your custom objects to behave like built-in types.\n","\n","6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOPS ?\n","\n"," ▶ Inheritance allows programmers to create classes that are built upon existing classes, to specify a new implementation while maintaining the same behaviors(realizing an interface), to reuse code and to independently extend original software via public classes and interfaces.\n","\n","7. What is polymorphism in OOPS ?\n","\n"," ▶ Polymorphism is one of the most important concepts in OOP. It describes the ability of something to have or to displayed in more than one form. The different forms arise because these entities can be assigned different meanings and used in various ways in multiple contexts.\n","\n","8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python ?\n","\n"," ▶ Encapsulation is achieved by declaring a class's data members and methods as either private or protected. But in python, we do not have keywords like public,private and protected,as in case of java. Instead, we achieve this by using single and double underscores.\n","\n","9. What is a constructor in Python ?\n","\n"," ▶ In python, a constructor is a special method called when an object is created. Its purpose is to assign values to the data members within the class when an object is intialized.\n","\n","10. What are class and static methods in Python ?\n","\n"," ▶ A class method can access or modify the class state while a static method can't access or modify it. In general, static methods know nothing about the class state. They are utility-type methods that take some parameters that take some parameters and work upon those parameters. On the other hand class methods must have class as a parameter.\n","\n","11. What is method overloading in Python ?\n","\n"," ▶ The concept of method overloading in python refers to the ability to define multiple methods of the same name, but with different parameters. In many object-oriented programming languages, overloading is used to create different implementations of a method, depending on the number or type of arguments passed.\n","\n","12. What is method overriding in OOP ?\n","\n"," ▶ Method overriding in object-oriented programming, is a language feauture that allows a subclass or child class to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by one of its superclasses or parent classes.\n","\n","13.  What is a property decorator in Python ?\n","\n"," ▶ A decorator is a design pattern in python that allows a user to add new functionality to an existing object without modifying its structure. Decorators are typically applied to functions, and they play a crucial role in enhancing or modifying the behavior of functions.\n","\n","14. Why is polymorphism important in OOPS ?\n","\n"," ▶ Polymorphism is a core principle in OOPS and used in various aspects of software development. It promotes code reuse, flexibility and extensibility by allowing objects of different classes to be treated as object of a common superclass or interface.\n","\n","15. What is an abstract class in Python ?\n","\n"," ▶ In python, an abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own and is meant to be subclassed by other classes. Abstract classes are created using abc(Abstract Base Classes) module.\n","\n","16. What are the advantages of OOPS ?\n","\n"," ▶ Advantages of OOPS:-\n","\n"," 1. We can build the programs from standard working modules that communicate with one another, rather than having to start writing code from scratch which leads to saving of development time and higher productivity.\n","\n"," 2. OOPS language allows to break the program into the bit-sized promblems that can be solved easily(one object at a time).\n","\n"," 3. The new technology promises greater programmer productivity, better quality of software and lesser maintenance cost.\n","\n"," 4. It is possible that multiple instances of object co-exist without any interference.\n","\n"," 5. OOPS systems can be easily upgraded from small to large systems\n","\n","17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable ?\n","\n"," ▶ Instance variable:-\n","\n","    1. They declared without using keyword 'static'.\n","\n","    2. Each object of the class gets its own copy of instance variables.\n","\n","    3. They can be accessed only through the object of the class.\n","\n","  ▶ Class variable:-\n","    \n","    1. They are declared using keyword 'static'\n","\n","    2. All the objects of a class share of same copy of class variables.\n","\n","    3. They can be accessed using the class name or object.\n","\n","18. What is multiple inheritance in Python ?\n","\n"," ▶ Multiple inheritances are when a child class is derived from two or more parent classes. For example, you are inheriting some of the features from your father and some from your mother. In this case, we have to write the names of both parent classes inside the brackets of the child class.\n","\n","19. Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python ?\n","\n"," ▶ __str__ is used for informal string representations, such as printing objects for user consumption. __repr__ is used for formal string representations, including debugging, logging and object inspection.\n","\n","20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python ?\n","\n"," ▶ In python, super() is a builtin function that allows access to methods and properties of a parent or superclass from a child or subclass.\n","\n","21.  What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python ?\n","\n"," ▶ The __del__ method in python is a powerful tool for managing resource cleanup when objects are destroyed. It allows you to define specific actions that should be taken when an object is garbage collected, such as closing files, releasing locks, or closing network connections.\n","\n","22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python ?\n","\n"," ▶ Class method Vs Static method\n","\n","    1. A class method takes cls as the first parameter while a static method needs no specific parameters.\n","\n","    2. A class method can access or modify the class state while a static method can't access or modify it.\n","\n","    3. In general. static methods know nothing about the class state. They are utility type methods that take some parameters and work upon those parameters. On the other hand class methods must have class as a paramete.\n","\n","    4. We use @classmethod decorator in python to create a class method and we use @staticmethod decorator to create a static method in python.\n","\n","23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance ?\n","\n"," ▶ Polymorphism in python, specifically when used with inheritance, enables objects of different classes to respond to the same method call in a way that is specific to thier class.This is achieved through method overriding , where a subclass provide its own implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class.\n","\n"," For Example:-\n"],"metadata":{"id":"zPM3k_WfVzqf"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["class Animal:\n","  def speak(self):\n","    return \"generic animal sound\"\n","class Dog(Animal):\n","  def speak(self):\n","    return \"woof! woof!\"\n","class Cat(Animal):\n","  def speak(meow):\n","    return \"meow!\"\n","\n","cat=Cat()\n","cat.speak()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":35},"id":"viFsXUkn2-f6","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1748267623454,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":21,"user":{"displayName":"Shubham Yadav","userId":"17612701105650508696"}},"outputId":"cbb9cd9e-4b2a-40eb-c00d-e3681f57db96"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["'meow!'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":2}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["24.
